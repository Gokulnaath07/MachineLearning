Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Developer position at Al Warren Oil Company. As a Master’s student in Computer Science and an international student with a strong passion for technology and software development, I am eager to apply my skills and gain hands-on experience in a dynamic and impactful environment.

Throughout my academic journey, I have built a solid foundation in programming, working with languages such as Python and Java, and have experience with SQL-based database management. I have also contributed to real-world projects involving API integrations, backend development, and cloud services like AWS. My coursework and project experiences have strengthened my ability to develop efficient, user-focused applications and collaborate within cross-functional teams.

What excites me about this opportunity is the chance to contribute to operational innovation within the fuel and logistics industry while learning from experienced professionals. I’m particularly drawn to the practical, business-oriented nature of the role—building tools that directly support operations, billing, and customer-facing applications.

I would be thrilled to further discuss how my background and enthusiasm align with the needs of your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Gokulnaath Govindaraj
